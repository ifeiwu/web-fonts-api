    "description": "Ovo was inspired by a set of hand lettered caps seen in a 1930's lettering guide. The capitals suggested the time in which they were made because of the soft serif treatment used. This detail and a subtle casual feeling creeping into the otherwise classical forms led to the soft genial lowercase and the whimsical numbers now seen in Ovo. Ovo is a medium contrast serif font. Because of the old style variable letter widths and subtle detail it will work best at medium to large sizes.",
