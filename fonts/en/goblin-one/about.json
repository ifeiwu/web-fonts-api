Goblin was inspired by a hand painted sign above a pub in the town of Reading (UK). Goblin is a somewhat wide medium contrast design with a large x height. Goblin is both attention getting and fun. Goblin is suitable for use in medium to large sizes including headlines. This font was made specifically to be web type.",
